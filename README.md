## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data science process, as it helps identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data. In this repository, we demonstrate how to perform EDA using the Pandas Profiling library within a Jupyter Notebook. The Pandas Profiling library automates much of the EDA process, generating comprehensive reports with insightful visualizations to facilitate data understanding.

## Requirements

To run the EDA Jupyter Notebook, you will need the following software and libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Pandas Profiling

## Getting Started

To get started with the EDA Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Briankim254/Explaratory-data-analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd Explaratory-data-analysis`
3. Install the required libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook`

## Usage

1. Open the `EDA_with_Pandas_Profiling.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook
2. Load your dataset by replacing the sample dataset in the `read_csv()` function with your own CSV file
3. Run all cells in the notebook to generate the Pandas Profiling report
4. Explore the interactive report to better understand your dataset, identifying patterns, trends, and outliers

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to improve and expand the EDA repository. To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes
2. Make your changes or additions to the project
3. Create a pull request and wait for a review from a team member

Please ensure that your code adheres to best practices for code quality and documentation.
